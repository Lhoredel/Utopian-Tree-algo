# Utopian-Tree-algo
This code modeling the growth cycle of a tree that doubles in height every spring and grows by 1 meter every summer helps this project to resolve the Utopian Tree problem. Starting from a height of one meter, the program loops through every growth cycle, alternating doubling the height in odd-numbered cycles with one meter in even-numbered cycles.
